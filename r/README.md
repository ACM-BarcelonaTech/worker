R worker
========

Getting started
---------------

Development is done inside a development container that is automatically built, run, and managed by Visual Studio Code. You **do not**
need R or R Studio to be installed locally.

To develop on the R worker, you must have the following VS Code extensions installed:

    * the [R](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ikuyadeu.r) extension
    * the [R LSP Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r-lsp) extension
    * the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension

Quit VS Code and re-start for these plugins to be loaded.
