worker
======

The single-cell pipeline work executor.

Setup
-----

Development is done inside a development container that is automatically built,
run, and managed by Visual Studio Code. You **do not** need R, R Studio, or a Python
virtual environment to be installed locally.

You must have the following VS Code extensions installed:

* the [R](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ikuyadeu.r) extension
* the [R LSP Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r-lsp) extension
* the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension

Quit VS Code and re-start for these plugins to be loaded. You should see a green icon
in the leftmost part of the status bar.
